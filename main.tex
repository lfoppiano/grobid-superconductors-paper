\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The automatic extraction of materials and related properties from the scientific literature is getting more attention in data-driven materials science (Materials Informatics). 
We present our system for automatically extract superconductor material names and respective properties from PDF documents.
Our system combines Machine Learning and Heuristic approaches using a flexible architecture: developers can plug-in various Named Entities Recognition (NER) methods (CRF, BidLSTM, Transformers) or relation extraction approaches (ruled-based, CRF).
We have processed 37700 papers and extracted 40324 materials-properties records. 
The material, or sample information is represented by name, chemical formula, and material class, and characterised by shape, doping, variables for components, substrate as adjoined information.
The properties include the T\textsubscript{c} superconducting critical temperature and, when available, applied pressure with T\textsubscript{c} measurement method.

\section{Introduction}
In recent years, with the creation of computational databases, such as the Materials Project (MP)~\cite{materialsprojectJain2013}, the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD)~\cite{oqmdkirklin2015open}, and then experimental data repositories such as NIMS MDR (\url{http://mdr.nims.go.jp})~\cite{ranganathan_anusha_2019_3553963}, the focus has been steadily shifting towards a data-driven design of materials which is often called as Materials Informatics (MI). 
Such an approach is expected to accelerate exploration of functional materials, as it does not rely on intuition of very little genius researchers nor on their limited experience.
In this new paradigm, the efficient use of data to guide experiments and materials property prediction through use of machine learning methods takes the centre stage. 
For example, data-driven methods have been used to search/design magneto-caloric materials~\cite{Bocarsly2017,Castro2020-12,court2021inverse}, photo-catalysts for hydrogen splitting~\cite{xiong2021optimizing}, thermoeletrics~\cite{iwasaki2019machine}, and superconductors~\cite{stanev_machine_2017}. 
In such a data-driven search, one of the most important keys lies at the availability of the data, that at least should consist of compositions of materials and their physical properties. 
In the specific case of superconductivity, most of the data-driven works~\cite{stanev_machine_2017, le2020critical,Hamlin2019SuperconductivityNR} relies on a single database: SuperCon (\url{http://supercon.nims.go.jp}). 

SuperCon is a structured database of superconductors materials and their properties, developed at the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) in Japan. 
At the time of writing this paper, SuperCon contains about 33000 inorganic and 600 organic materials and is the ``de-facto'' standard in data-driven research for superconductors materials  (about 4400 articles contains the mention ``\textit{supercon database}'' in Google Scholar). 
However, SuperCon harvesting process is currently fully manual and the efficiency is directly proportional to the number of available human curators.
The process is performed ``from scratch'': the human have to read the human-readable printed matter such as PDF document and manually enter the information in the system.
Considering the cost of database construction, it is necessary to consider an assisted or alternative system that improves throughput while ensuring data quality equivalent to that of manual extraction.

As a solution, we are developing an hybrid data extraction methods from scientific literature combining automation using text data mining and manual curation.
The automated system pre-extracts and formats potential data and proposes them to the curator as ``pre-cooked'' structured data: (a) Highlight the relevant entities on the original document. 
(b) Pre-fill the extracted information in an editable tabular content. 
% By linking (a) highlighted source text and (b) structured information, curators can quickly move back and forth between (a) and (b). 
In building the automatic part of this hybrid system (training, evaluation) we used SuperMat~\cite{foppiano2021supermat}, which we recently constructed. 
% This is a dataset linked to data annotated against the full text of the scientific literature on superconductivity research. 
% We used SuperMat not only as training data for machine learning, but also for NLP evaluation.

% 6. in this work we present X, where we did Y and obtain Z
In this work, we present \textit{grobid-superconductors}: a system to extract automatically structured information of superconductors materials and properties from scientific literature. 
The tool is a specialised module of Grobid~\cite{GROBID}, a machine learning library to parse and structure scientific documents. 
Grobid provides an open source platform for building specialised modules: from astronomical entities recognition to software mentions and physical measurements extraction.
Grobid provide several built-in features including extraction of PDF document layout information, citation extraction and linking within the content, bibliographic data consolidation with CrossRef data through biblio-glutton~\cite{biblio-glutton-lookup} a fast open source reference matching service, and a diverse pluggable set of ML architectures from a fast linear Conditional Random Field (CRF) to the latest state-of-the-art deep learning implementations.

% 7. what is our purpose? 
Using grobid-superconductors and other sub-tools, we established a pipeline for processing large quantity of documents and obtaining an automated database of superconductors materials and properties. 
We processed 37770 papers from ArXiv\footnote{\url{https://arxiv.org}} and obtained a database of 40324 records. 
This new database was named SuperCon\textsuperscript{2} as an automated staging system that would work with SuperCon through a curated interface. 
The project was also an opportunity to enrich SuperCon's database structure with properties that gained interests in recent scientific trends. 
The ``pressure'' applied to obtain superconductivity (about 20 records in Supercon), has gained attention because it can change radically the electronic structure of a material.
The ``method'' used to measure the superconducting transition temperature \tc~(about 600 records in SuperCon) can be used to semantically recognise multiple \tc s obtained from the same material or sample (e.g. distinguish calculated and experimental \tc). 


\section{Grobid-superconductors}

% Overview from the other paper, what are the differences and some repetition on the previous paper 
\textit{Grobid-superconductor} is an extraction system that allow the processing of text or PDF documents to extract materials and corresponding properties. 
We develop \textit{grobid-superconductors} as a multi-steps tool based on the \textit{Grobid} library~\cite{GROBID} following some principles discussed in a previous preliminary study~\cite{foppiano:hal-02870896}.  
The choice to develop it as a \textit{Grobid} module bring several advantages: a) It integrates with \textit{pdfalto}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto}}, a specialised tool for converting PDF to XML which mitigate extraction issues such as the resolution of embedded fonts, invalid character encoding, and the reconstruction of the correct reading order. 
b) It allows to access to PDF document layout information for both machine learning and document decoration (e.g. coordinates in the PDF document) and, finally, c) it provides access to a set of high-quality, pre-trained machine learning models for structuring documents.
\textit{Grobid-superconductors} is structured as a three-steps process as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline-overview} and described in the following sections~\ref{subsubsec:document-structuring},~\ref{subsubsec:extraction}, and~\ref{subsubsec:linking}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{overview-schema-3}
\caption{Processing pipeline for extracting superconductors materials and properties. }
\label{fig:pipeline-overview}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Abstract vs fulltext}
At the time of writing this paper, we are aware of related works that utilise text from abstract as training data for machine learning. 
The main reason is that abstracts are usually easily and freely available as text~\cite{kononova_text-mined_2019}, and contain condensed information~\cite{yamaguchi-etal-2020-sc, court_magnetic_2020}. 
However, in material research publications, full texts contain a broader range of information, including the samples preparation process, negative results (e.g. absence of superconductivity for certain samples), background information (e.g. report on other materials from referenced works). 
% Such examples are needed to supply knowledge of non-superconductivity when building a superconductors prediction model~\cite{stanev_machine_2017}. 
Although, accurately parsing the full text presents more challenges, they are mitigated by the \textit{Grobid} library, therefore our \textit{grobid-superconductors} is fully supporting full-text documents. 

% Sentences vs Paragraphs 
\paragraph{Paragraphs vs sentences}
% In grobid-superconductors we use sentences as the unit of text for processing.
Another ``debate'' in the NLP community is whether to use sentences or paragraphs as text processing unit. 
In general, the use of sentences or paragraphs based approach is very dependent on the task at hand. [citation needed]
Sentences are smaller by definition (English writing guidelines recommend less than 25 words), paragraphs have less guidelines and can grow uncontrolled.
Grobid already extracts paragraphs from PDF documents while sentence requires to apply a segmenter. 
On the other hand, in deep learning there are advantages by using sentences: a) one sentence is very likely to stay within the "max sequence length" limitation (e.g. 512 tokens for transformers), b) in training, shorter examples uses less memories can be trained with larger batch size, c) BERT/SciBERT models are trained on sentences because the second task solved is, actually, "next sentence prediction".

To evaluate which approach would be better in NER for our cases, we trained (3 documents) and evaluate (1 document) a sequence labelling model for each versions (paragraphs-based and sequence-based) on four annotated documents from SuperMat~\cite{foppiano2021supermat}.
As indicated in Table~\ref{tab:comparison-evaluation-sentences-paragraphs}, the F1-score improved by 64\% (increase of 17.94\%).
Our intuition suggests that this improvement can be mainly explained by the increase in the number of training examples for the same amount of text.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering\small
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Label} & \textbf{Precision} & \textbf{Recall} & \textbf{F1} \\
\midrule
Paragraph-based micro avg. & 44.44 & 27.21 & 33.76   \\
Sentence-based micro avg. & 48.41 & 50.00 & 51.70  \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:comparison-evaluation-sentences-paragraphs} Results from cross-validation using sentence-based or paragraphs based.  }
\end{table}

On the Linking task, although our previous work~\cite{foppiano2019proposal} showed that linking entities within paragraphs could obtained a higher F1 than in sentences (18.01\% vs 11.87\%). This result was boosted by the increase in the recall (6.5\% to 10.7\%) being higher than the loss in the precision(68.7\% to 57\%).
Nevertheless, since the sentence-based approach achieves a higher precision, which in this work is more important this is trade-off to justifies our choice of sentence-based linking. 

\subsection{Document structuring and pre-processing}
\label{subsubsec:document-structuring}
In the document pre-processing and structuring, the PDF document is converted into an internal model for subsequent internal processing, based on a list of text statements, tokens, and features. 
The input document is processed using the Grobid original models where we apply customised processes for document header and content. 
We select a subset bibliographic information from the header: title, authors, DOI, publisher, journal, and year of publication and we consolidate them against CrossRef\footnote{\url{https://www.crossref.org}} to match the  publishers quality (even by processing the ``preprint version'' of the publication). 
The superconductors entities extraction is applied on the content, only on relevant text items, such as abstract, body and annex paragraphs, figure and table captions (Figure~\ref{fig:grobid-document-processing}).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\label{fig:grobid-document-processing}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{grobid-extraction-2}
\caption{Grobid-superconductors extraction processes (bibliographic information, superconductors entities extraction and sentence segmentation) within the Grobid cascade data flow.}
\end{figure}

We use the collected reference markers (also called \textit{reference callout}) from text items as features for improving the paragraphs segmentation in sentences: the segmentation is cancelled if the end of sentence falls within the boundaries of a reference marker. 
For example, a sentence containing a marker in the form ``\textit{Foppiano et. al.}'' may be mistakenly segmented at ``\textit{et.}''.

The sentences are accumulated within the internal model objects which is modified by attaching new information during the course of the process. 
The main properties are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{LayoutTokens} stores the layout information of each token: style (italic, bold, superscript, and subscript), font (font type, font size), positions (coordinates (a list of pairs x,y), offset position), 
    \item \textit{section} and \textit{subsection} are the Grobid main sections: header, body and annex, and the second-level processing (paragraph, table or figure caption, abstract, title), respectively,
    \item \textit{spans} collects extracted entities including type, attributes (as key-value information), and offsets within text and layout tokens.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Entities Extraction}
\label{subsubsec:extraction}

The second step is the \textit{Entities Extraction} performing the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task on previously extracted text. 

\subsubsection{Overview}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{extraction-schema-4}
\caption{\label{fig:extraction-ml-models-cascade-architecture} Cascade architecture and interaction between the superconductors, and the material parser. The white rectangles indicate the extracted information (described in Tables~\ref{tab:superconductors-parser-entities} and~\ref{tab:material-parser-entities}). 
The ML models and the rule-based algorithms are identified by light grey and dark grey shapes, respectively.}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:extraction-ml-models-cascade-architecture} the ``superconductors parser'' extracts the main superconductors-related information listed in Table~\ref{tab:superconductors-parser-entities}. 
Here we aggregate entities extracted by the \textit{superconductors ML model}, and temperatures and pressures from the \textit{quantities ML model} for measurement extraction~\cite{foppiano2019quantities}. 
Overlapping entities are merged: exact duplicates are removed and largest entities (in terms of string lenght) are preserved.

\label{tab:superconductors-parser-entities}
\end{table}

The entities of type materials are passed in cascade to the ``material parser'' which combines ML and tools to extract further information and structures summarised in Table~\ref{tab:material-parser-entities}. 
First, the material raw string is passed through a \textit{material ML model} to segment the raw material string. 
Then, we apply several processing based on which information are available: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item formulas are decomposed into a structured composition. We identify each pair of element-stoichiometry (e.g ``O'': 7.0) mat2chem~\cite{kononova_text-mined_2019} and Pymatgen~\cite{Ong2013}, 
    \item if only the name is available, we obtain the formula (e.g. hydrogen to \textit{H}), 
    \item we tag the formula with classes such as Cuprate, Oxides, Alloys using heuristics algorithm we designed, 
    \item using the extracted variables and values we apply permutation to the  formula to resolve the substitutions. For example the formula \texttt{La 4 Fe 2 A 1-x O 7 (A=Mg,Co; x=0.1,0.2)} is substituted for the permutation of the values of A and x to become \texttt{La 4 Fe 2 Mg 0.9 O 7}, \texttt{La 4 Fe 2 Mg 0.8 O 7}, \texttt{La 4 Fe 2 Co 0.9 O 7}, \texttt{La 4 Fe 2 Co 0.8 O 7}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\scalebox{0.7}{
\begin{tabular}{m{16em} m{30em}}
\toprule
\textbf{Entity} (\textbf{Tag})& \textbf{Description} \\ 
\midrule
Name (\texttt{<name>}) & The canonical name of a material (e.g. Hydrogen, PCCO, Carbon) \\
Formula (\texttt{<formula>}) & Chemical formula of the material (e.g. \texttt{Pr1.869Ce0.131CuO 4-}, \texttt{MgB2}, \texttt{La 2-x Sr x CuO 4}) \\
Doping (\texttt{<doping>})& Doping ratio and doping materials that are adjoined to the material name (e.g. \texttt{Zn-doped}, \texttt{2\% Zn-doped})\\
Shape (\texttt{<shape>}) & shape of the material (e.g. single crystal, polycrystalline, thin film, powder, film) \\
Substitution variables (\texttt{<variable>}) & Variables that can be substituted in the formula. \\
Substitution values (\texttt{<value>}) & Values expressed in the doping. \\
Substrate (\texttt{<substrate>}) & Substrates as defined in the material name \\
Fabrication (\texttt{<fabrication>}) & Represent eventual additional information that are not belonging to any of the previous tags  (e.g. intercalated, electron-doped)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
}
\caption{\label{tab:material-parser-entities} Synthesis of the material parser entities. }
\end{table}

Finally, the post-processing aggregates different entities of the same materials using the parsed formulas at document level. 
For example \texttt{hydrogen} and \texttt{H} or formula with partial substitutions such as \texttt{La 2 Fe 1-x O 7 (x = 0.1, 0.2)} with materials like \texttt{La 2 Fe 0.9 O 7} appearing in other sections of the same document. 

\subsubsection{Machine Learning study}

In this section we discuss the novel ML models we have trained for extracting specialised entities: \textit{superconductors ML model} and \textit{material ML model} (Section~\ref{subsubsec:extraction}). 
SuperMat~\cite{foppiano2021supermat}, our training dataset, count 162 papers at the time of writing and is composed by annotated full-text and layout features from PDF documents. 

For both ML models we trained and evaluated these four architecture/implementations: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item linear CRF (CRF)
    \item Bidirectional LSTM with CRF~\cite{Lample2016NeuralAF} (BidLSTM\_CRF)
    \item Bidirectional LSTM with CRF~\cite{Lample2016NeuralAF} is the same as the previous with an additional input channel for features (BidLSTM\_CRF\_FEATURES)
    \item SciBERT~\cite{Beltagy2019SciBERT} using a CRF as activation layer (Scibert)
\end{itemize}

The ML models are interfaced by Grobid, which uses the Wapiti\cite{lavergne2010practical} implementation for linear CRF, and DeLFT (Deep Learning For Text)~\cite{DeLFT} for deep learning models.
The architectures CRF and BidLSTM\_CRF\_FEATURES make uses of orthogonal features we have summarised in Table~\ref{tab:ML-model-features}. 

\paragraph{Superconductors ML model}

\subparagraph{Holdout set}
The holdout set must be balanced and should follow the same distribution of the target dataset. 
We assembled the holdout set by manually selecting from SuperMat 32 documents (24\%) with the same ratio of training examples, entities and unique entities (Figure~\ref{fig:training-holdout-set-distribution}a).
Maintaining the same rate (80/20) for entity type is more challenging: in average, we obtained around 15-18\% of labels of each type in the holdout set in average (Figure~\ref{fig:training-holdout-set-distribution}b), except for the \texttt{<material>} label (23\%) (Tables~\ref{tab:training-holdout-set-distribution-annex} and \ref{tab:training-holdout-distribution-labels}). 
The remaining 76\% (132 documents) is used for training. 

We define the out-of-domain ratio as the number of unique entities from the holdout set that are not in the training set. 
The holdout set out-of-domain ratio is in average around 72\%, which require the model to be able to generalise well. 
All the labels have off-domain rate above 24\%  (Figure~\ref{fig:out-domain-holdout}) with the highest for the \texttt{<material>} at 82\%. The labels \texttt{<me\_method>} have the lowest off-domain ratio at 25\% which can be explained by a high uniqueness of entities (355 entities are reduced to 57 unique). 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{holdout-training-set}
\caption{Holdout/Training set distribution (a) general metrics and (b) entities labels.
\textit{\# entities} and \textit{\# unique entities} indicate the number of labelled entities with and without value duplicates, respectively. \textit{positive examples} (+) indicates the number of sentences with at least one entity and \textit{negative examples} (-) the number of sentences with no entities.}

\end{figure}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{out-domain-holdout-unique}

\label{fig:out-domain-holdout}
\end{figure}

\subparagraph{Positive sampling} 
We train the model with positive sampling by removing the examples without entities (negative examples, Figure~\ref{fig:training-holdout-set-distribution}). 
Compared with no sampling, this approach provides an improvement by +2\% in both precision and recall, when testing against the holdout set. 
Experiments with active and random sampling which improve results in highly imbalanced datasets~\cite{lopez2021mining} did not provide stable evidences suggesting improvements for our task. 

\subparagraph{Evaluation}

We report the evaluation results for the \textit{superconductors ML model} in Table~\ref{tab:evaluation-superconductors-ML-model}. 
The best results was obtained by Scibert with an F1 of 77.03\%, and recall around 80.69\%. 
The features did not provide any improvements with RNN models: BidLSTM\_CRF and BidLSTM\_CRF\_FEATURES resulted in the same F1 score.
This result comes as a surprise because features such superscript/subscript were expected to be determinant for recognising materials sequences. 

The \texttt{<pressure>} label obtained the lowest performances for all architectures, we believe 274 training examples are not sufficient considering that pressure expressions are used in different contexts (e.g. annealing pressure).
% The entity labels variability (ratio of unique entities versus the total) is, in average, around 55\%, and 57\% for the training and holdout sets, respectively. \texttt{<tc>} (12\%) and \texttt{me\_method} have the lowest variability while the \texttt{<material>} has the highest. 

Scibert also show good generalisation capacity for unseen examples or for examples appearing in a different context. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:example-comparison-architectures}a we show an example where only Scibert correctly extracts ``above 100K'', while CRF miss it completely and BidLSTM\_CRF misses ``above''. 
In the training data ``above 100K'' is not present, however we have ``below 100K'' and ``\~100K'', and we have several other entities with ``above'' within: ``above 30K'', ``above 2K'', etc. 
Scibert is able to understand that the token ``above'' is somehow relevant to the temperature. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:example-comparison-architectures}b we have another example where Scibert can correctly extract ``W-C nanowire'', that is not present in the SuperMat training data. 
Unfortunately we cannot check whether ``above 100K'' or ``W-C nanowire'' are also present in the dataset used for pre-train SciBERT by their authors~\cite{Beltagy2019SciBERT}.

The annotations are performed on smaller chunks of text and the throughput is largely higher than the initial effort to develop SuperMat, we created an independent holdout set. 
We used material data extracted from a dataset of 500 documents (500-papers) from three publishers: \textit{American Institute of Physics} (AIP), \textit{American Physical Society} (APS) and \textit{Institute of Physics} (IOP)~\cite{foppiano2019proposal}.
The resulting holdout set has a average coverage above 25\% (Figure~\ref{fig:material-training-holdout-set-distribution}) and an off-domain ratio of 83.93\% (Figure\ref{fig:material-out-domain-holdout}). 
The labels \texttt{<substrate>} and \texttt{<shape>} are over-represented and this could impact by lower the scores for these two labels during evaluation.

\subparagraph{Evaluation}

The results shown in Table~\ref{tab:evaluation-10fold-material-parser} indicate that Scibert obtains the best results, with F1 at 84.15\%.
As for the \textit{superconductors ML model}, the use of features with the BidLSTM\_CRF architecture improves the results only by less than 1\% (from 83.13 to 83.76\%) which suggest that features can be omitted. 
The label \texttt{<fabrication>} does not perform well with any architecture because it is too generic (Table~\ref{tab:material-parser-entities}) and the content is too heterogeneous. \texttt{<substrate>} hass 1/3 of the training examples but obtains results 3 times higher with Scibert. 
For such cases we should consider splitting \texttt{<fabrication>} into separate and more homogeneous labels.

\subsection{Entity Linking}
\label{subsubsec:linking}

%Introduction of the linking
The ``Linking'' aims to perform entity linking (EL) between materials and their corresponding properties.
%Objective of the linking
% We can formalised it as follows. \textit{Given a text T and two or more entities e\textsubscript{1}...e\textsubscript{n} of two types t\textsubscript{1} and t\textsubscript{2}, determine links between entities of type t\textsubscript{1} can be linked to entities of type t\textsubscript{2} .} 

%We have experimented several options: dependency parsing, rule-based, and sequence labelling. 
We use a rule-based algorithm; other approaches such as the use of dependency parsing~\cite{yoshikawa:2017acl, Tiktinsky2020pyBARTES, swayamdipta:17, zhou-zhao-2019-head} were discarded. 
It was difficult to find a suitable dependency parser for scientific texts, and complementary methods based on complex rule sets were needed to compensate for the poor performance of the parser.

We link pair of entities focusing on three types of relationships: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{material-tcValue} between material and its corresponding superconducting critical temperature value \tc which is further analysed by a classifier that establish whether it's a superconducting critical temperature or not, 
    \item \textbf{tcValue-pressure} between superconducting critical temperature value and its related critical pressure, and 
    \item \textbf{me\_method-tcValue} connects the superconducting critical temperature value to its corresponding measurement method.
    % \item \textbf{material-crystal\_structure} link the material with their crystal structure, and 
    % \item \textbf{material-space\_group} to link the material to their space groups.
\end{itemize}

% Algorithm in brief (three or four different scenario): 
\subsubsection{T\textsubscript{c} classification}
This rule-based classifier combines the extracted entities of T\textsubscript{c} expressions (label \texttt{<tc>}) with a set of predefined standard names. 
When a T\textsubscript{c} is not considered a ``superconducting critical temperature'' it is excluded from the list of possible linking candidates. 

The rule-based approach works considering two scenarios: a) if entities to be linked have cardinality one in the sentence, they are linked automatically, and b) when their cardinality is higher then they are linked ``by distance'' or ``in order'', depending on the structure of the sentence. 
If the word \textit{``respectively''} appears in the sentence, entities are linked ``in order'', otherwise they are linked ``by distance''. 
For example, the sentence:  
\begin{displayquote}
P-or Ba-122  and Co-doped Ba-122 have lower T c s of about 30 K and 24 K, respectively, which makes helium free operation questionable.
\end{displayquote}
containing the word ``respectively'' and therefore is processed by linking the materials in order: \textit{P-or Ba122} is assigned to \textit{30 K} and \textit{Co-doped Ba-122} to \textit{24 K}.
The ``in order'' method is very sensible to missing entities, for example if one entity is not extracted by mistake it will lead to incorrectly assign all the entities in the block. To avoid this, if the entities are unbalanced we reduce the search space as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item m entities of label\textsubscript{1} vs n entities of label\textsubscript{2} with $m > n$: we shift the starting point to start at the $m - $n entity 
    \item m entities of label\textsubscript{1} vs n entities of label\textsubscript{2} with $m < n$: we shift the ending point at the n\textsubscript{-1} entity
\end{itemize}

With this sentence structure we know that the entities are in order, however if one is missing we just ignore the entities in surplus without disrupting the already made linking. 

We define the distance measurement \textit{d} as a value calculated in numbers of characters from the centre of each entities. 
If the entity is surrounded by parenthesis we expand it to the whole parenthesis and by consequence its centre position is updated. 
As an example, in the sentence
\begin{displayquote}
We tested two materials MgB2 (Tc = 39 K) and FeSe (Tc = 16 K).
\end{displayquote}
both temperatures entities are expanded to their containing parenthesis e.g. \texttt{39 K} to \texttt{(Tc = 39 K)} in this case the centre of the entity \texttt{39 K} was shifted toward the left, from the initial value of 38 to 35 and the distance from \texttt{MgB2} is reduced from 11 to 8.
As a result, the distance between an entity and the parenthesis block decreases. 

The distance calculation is also adjusted with the addition of ``penalties'' by doubling the calculated distance when certain keywords such as ``,'', ``.'', ``;'', ``and'', ``but', ``while', ``whereas', ``which'', ``although'' representing logical separation of predicates appear between the two entities~\cite{oka2021table}. 

The rule-based linking is evaluated using the linked entities from SuperMat~\cite{foppiano2021supermat} (Table~\ref{table:evaluation-linking}). 
Each task aims evaluating the linking between two entities types, assuming a 100\% accuracy in the Extraction step. 
The result of the \texttt{material-tcValue} indicates F1 score $>$80\% with a precision of 88\%.

% \subsubsection{Sequence labelling linking} 
% We designed the linking based on sequence labelling as a simple task where each token can be assigned two labels: \texttt{<link\_left>} or \texttt{<link\_right>}. 
% Furthermore, a decoder processing the labelled sequence is assigning links to entities.
% We trained three models, one model for each link type (or entity class pair), using SuperMat~\cite{foppiano2021supermat}.
% The evaluation was performed using 10-fold cross-validation (Table~\ref{tab:evaluation-crf-linking-cross-validation}) with F1 score of 69.16\% for material-tcValue, 44.65\% for tcValue-pressure and 69.66\% for tcValue-me\_method.

% \end{table}

% This approach has a several limitations which impact effectiveness in training and tagging. 
% Firstly, since the sequence is flat, (a) it is limited to pairs of adjacent entities. Secondly, (b) the decoding of the annotated sequence is challenging and the linking will not be successful if the sequence of ``right-left'' labels goes out of sync e.g. if the model tags two subsequent entities with the same label one needs to be ignored. Finally, (c) this architecture limit the benefit of the training data, because it supports only certain type of sequences with adjacent entities. The model for tcValue-me\_method is particularly impacted by this limitation because the method of measurement is discussed often far from the actual results are illustrated. 


\subsection{End to end evaluation}

% What is the end 2 end evaluation? 
The end to end evaluation (E2EE) measures the real capacity of the system from document to database.
We limit the scope of the E2EE to the pair `material-Tc' and, when available, the triplet `material-Tc-pressure' which, at the moment, are the backbone on which the database is built upon.
We perform the E2EE on a the 500-papers dataset. 
We manually examine the resulting database, a) we mark records that are invalid and b) we identify the cause of failure from a predefined set of five \textit{error types} (Figure~\ref{fig:error-types}):  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{From table} indicate when the extracted text is wrongly extracted from a table. Although table content is ignored, the error rate from the Grobid library is still relevant due to lack of training data. 
    \item \textbf{Extraction} indicate when the failure was caused by entities not recognised, wrongly or partially recognised.
    \item \textbf{Quantities extraction} when the entities of type quantities (pressure, temperature) are not correctly extracted. We measured it separately to identify failure on a separate ML model.  
    \item \textbf{Tc classification} when the temperature is wrongly classified as superconducting Tc
    \item \textbf{Linking} when, given the precedent steps were performed correctly, the resulting entities were not linked correctly. 
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

The E2EE is summarised in Table~\ref{table:end2end-evaluation-summary}. 
We present only precision because is the metric we want to maximise. Recall is omitted because less relevant and difficult to calculate manually. 
We show the metrics by Title, Abstract, Paragraph, Figure caption, Unknown subsections and we provide average scores using micro-average. 
The system scores 72.60\% considering all the subsections. 
We notice there is a clear difference between error rates of Figure, caption and unknown sections with the other subsections. 
One solution to improve correctness, is to exclude text from certain subsections. 
The scores increase to 73\% when excluding unknown sections, to 75.24\% when excluding figure captions, and 79.14\%  when both. 
Both figure captions and unknown sections count for less then 20\% of the total number of sections.

The error types are summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:error-types-distribution}. The most common failures are originated by Tc classification (40\%), Linking (32\%), and Extraction (20\%).

The most commons Tc classification's failures are as incorrect recognition of: a) relative values of \tc (eg. 1 K higher than material X), values indicating the transition temperature width ($\Delta T_{c}$),  b) temperature values that are not \tc, for example: material synthesis temperatures $T$, other critical transition temperatures that are not superconducting (e.g $T_{Curie}$), and values of temperature at which there is no superconductivity (e.g at 70 K there is no superconductivity).
The errors of type ``Linking'' occurs mainly when the authors are comparing relative values of \tc~using materials for comparison (e.g. \textit{The Tc = 38 K is similar to the one of MgB$_{2}$}). 
Finally, ``Extraction'' issues are originated mainly from: a) implicit mention of the main material when experimented with different substrates, and b) mismatches between material and class.

The data is ingested through the Map-Reduce approach~\cite{10.1145/1327452.1327492}.
The ``Extraction task'' maps the PDF documents to their annotated and linked representation in JSON format described in Section~\ref{subsubsec:document-structuring}. 
Furthermore, the ``Aggregation task'' reduces the document information in a synthesised tabular format.
The pipeline uses a persistence layer for storage and reporting (logger) accessing \textit{grobid-superconductors} via REST API.

% \label{sucsec:supercon2-user-interface}
% SuperCon\textsubscript{2} can be utilised as text file (CSV or TSV) for processing and to build ML models and data-driven applications. 

% Although the automatic system might achieve good results and extract a large quantity of data, we are aware that some sort of ``user validation'' is required for improving the data quality. For this reason we have built SuperCon\textsubscript{2} with in mind the needs of an efficient curation interface. 
We built an visualisation interface to exploit the extracted information. 
Users can search in the synthesised tabular data, access the PDF document enriched with the extracted information (Figure~\ref{fig:pdf-annotations}), and export locally in CSV, TSV and Microsoft Excel formats.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work we present our solution for automatically building a database of materials and properties from scientific literature. 
Our contribution is composed by: a) \textit{grobid-superconductors}, a specialised open source system that processes PDF documents combining ML and rule-based methods to extract and link relevant information in superconductors research.
b) A pipeline allowing large scale document processing, and c) a visualisation interface for rapid data exploration which includes PDF documents information enrichment. 

We made SuperCon\textsuperscript{2}, a database with 40324 records of superconductors materials and properties including the applied pressure and the \tc~measurement method. 
SuperCon\textsubscript{2} is available in text format at \url{https://github.com/lfoppiano/supercon}.

In future, we have plan to improve our tools by: a) extracting more properties, such as crystal structure type, space groups type, and lattice structure, b) implement methodologies for the Linking step to replace the CRF implementation, and c) extend the interface to support data correction toward efficient curation.
We confirmed the good generalisation ability of the Scibert architecture for NER in materials science. 
There are hopes to obtain better results using materials science pre-trained BERT, such as matscibert~\cite{gupta_matscibert_2022}, however the gain might be just minimal for relatively larger models~\cite{hong2022ScholarBERT}.
